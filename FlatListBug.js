This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The error message might not be explicit, but you'll see performance issues like lagging, dropped frames, or even crashes.  This happens because React Native's `FlatList` is not optimized for handling a very large number of items efficiently. The default behavior of rendering every item at once leads to memory overload and performance degradation.
