The solution uses `keyExtractor`, `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `removeClippedSubviews`, and `windowSize` to optimize the `FlatList` performance. The `keyExtractor` ensures unique keys for each item.  `ItemSeparatorComponent` visually separates items. `removeClippedSubviews` enhances performance by removing offscreen components.  `windowSize` helps in controlling rendered items around the visible area, minimizing memory usage. This approach significantly reduces memory consumption and improves the responsiveness of the app when dealing with large datasets.
